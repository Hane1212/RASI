### 📋 Steps to Set Up the Project

Follow these instructions to set up the RASI project on your local machine.

#### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
   
First, create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for the project. You can name it anything you prefer (e.g., MLops).

python -m venv "your-env-name"

#### 2. Install Required Packages

Activate your virtual environment, then install the required dependencies from requirements.txt.

"your-env-name"\Scripts\activate

Once the virtual environment is activated, run the following command to install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 3. Train the Model

To train the model, run the Jupyter Notebook air_quality_prediction.ipynb. This file contains the code for training the model based on the air quality data.
Open air_quality_prediction.ipynb and follow the instructions inside to train your model.
